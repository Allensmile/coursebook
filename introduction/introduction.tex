\epigraph{To thy happy children of the future those of the past send greetings}{Alma Mater}

At the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, I fundamentally believe that we have a right to make the university better for all students who are coming to the future.
It is a message etched into our Alma Mater and makes up the DNA of our course staffs.
As such, we created the coursebook.
The coursebook is a free and open systems programming textbook that anyone can read, contribute to, and modify for now and forever.
We don't think information should be behind a walled garden, and we truly believe that complex concepts can be explained simply and fully for anyone to understand.
The goal of this book is to teach you the basics and some basic intuition about the complexities of systems programming.

As any good book, it isn't complete.
We still have lots of examples, ideas, typos, and chapters to work on.
If you find any, please file an issue or email a list of typos to course staff, and we'll be happy to work on it.
We are constantly trying to make the book better for students a year and ten years from now.

This work is based off of the original coursebook located at \link{https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki}.
This book was remixed under Creative Commons License 3.0.
And all the people's hard work is included in the section below.

Thanks again and happy reading!
