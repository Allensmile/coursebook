\chapter{Introduction}

Hey Everyone! Thanks for checking out the coursebook.
This project is very much still in beta but has been released to everyone, so we can iterate on it this semester and fill in any gaps for the coming semesters.
A few things to note

\begin{enumerate}
	\item This book strives for being more readable than compatible with the lectures, meaning that one lecture can go over many different sections of the book at various levels of resolution. The book is meant to be read through and make sense on a read through.
	\item This is still a collaborative effort, if you have thoughts, comments, suggestions, and fixes: please let us know!
\end{enumerate}

This work is based off of the original coursebook located at \link{https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki}.
Though we don't really know the line count number major contributors are listed on the front cover and minor contributors are listed on the site repo under the /AUTHORS file.
All copyrights belong respectively to their authors.
This book will remain free and open for anyone to read, contribute, and add on to now and forever.
Thanks again and happy reading!
