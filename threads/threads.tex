\section{Intro to Threads}\label{intro-to-threads}

\subsection{What is a thread?}\label{what-is-a-thread}

A thread is short for `thread-of-execution'. It represents the sequence
of instructions that the CPU has (and will) execute. To remember how to
return from function calls, and to store the values of automatic
variables and parameters a thread uses a stack.

\subsection{What is a Lightweight Process (LWP)? How does it relate to
threads?}\label{what-is-a-lightweight-process-lwp-how-does-it-relate-to-threads}

Well for all intents and purposes a thread is a process (meaning that
creating a thread is similar to \texttt{fork}) except there is
\textbf{no copying} meaning no copy on write. What this allows is for a
process to share the same address space, variables, heap, file
descriptors and etc.

The actual system call to create a thread is similar to \texttt{fork};
it's \texttt{clone}. We won't go into the specifics but you can read the
\href{http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html}{man pages}
keeping in mind that it is outside the direct scope of this course.

LWP or threads are preferred to forking for a lot of scenarios because
there is a lot less overhead creating them. But in some cases (notably
python uses this) multiprocessing is the way to make your code faster.

\subsection{How does the thread's stack
work?}\label{how-does-the-threads-stack-work}

Your main function (and other functions you might call) has automatic
variables. We will store them in memory using a stack and keep track of
how large the stack is by using a simple pointer (the ``stack
pointer''). If the thread calls another function, we move our stack
pointer down, so that we have more space for parameters and automatic
variables. Once it returns from a function, we can move the stack
pointer back up to its previous value. We keep a copy of the old stack
pointer value - on the stack! This is why returning from a function is
very quick - it's easy to `free' the memory used by automatic variables
- we just need to change the stack pointer.

In a multi threaded program, there are multiple stack but only one
address space. The pthread library allocates some stack space (either in
the heap or using a part of the main program's stack) and uses the
\texttt{clone} function call to start the thread at that stack address.
The total address space may look something like this.

\subsection{How many threads can my process
have?}\label{how-many-threads-can-my-process-have}

You can have more than one thread running inside a process. You get the
first thread for free! It runs the code you write inside `main'. If you
need more threads you can call \texttt{pthread\_create} to create a new
thread using the pthread library. You'll need to pass a pointer to a
function so that the thread knows where to start.

The threads you create all live inside the same virtual memory because
they are part of the same process. Thus they can all see the heap, the
global variables and the program code etc. Thus you can have two (or
more) CPUs working on your program at the same time and inside the same
process. It's up to the operating system to assign the threads to CPUs.
If you have more active threads than CPUs then the kernel will assign
the thread to a CPU for a short duration (or until it runs out of things
to do) and then will automatically switch the CPU to work on another
thread. For example, one CPU might be processing the game AI while
another thread is computing the graphics output.

\section{Simple Usage}\label{simple-usage}

\subsection{Hello world pthread
example}\label{hello-world-pthread-example}

To use pthreads you will need to include \texttt{pthread.h} AND you need
to compile with \texttt{-pthread} (or \texttt{-lpthread}) compiler
option. This option tells the compiler that your program requires
threading support

To create a thread use the function \texttt{pthread\_create}. This
function takes four arguments:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, }\DataTypeTok{const} \NormalTok{pthread_attr_t *attr,}
                   \DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*(*start_routine) (}\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*), }\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*arg);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first is a pointer to a variable that will hold the id of the
  newly created thread.
\item
  The second is a pointer to attributes that we can use to tweak and
  tune some of the advanced features of pthreads.
\item
  The third is a pointer to a function that we want to run
\item
  Fourth is a pointer that will be given to our function
\end{itemize}

The argument \texttt{void\ *(*start\_routine)\ (void\ *)} is difficult
to read! It means a pointer that takes a \texttt{void\ *} pointer and
returns a \texttt{void\ *} pointer. It looks like a function declaration
except that the name of the function is wrapped with
\texttt{(*\ ....\ )}

Here's the simplest example:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{#include <stdio.h>}
\OtherTok{#include <pthread.h>}
\CommentTok{// remember to set compilation option -pthread}

\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*busy(}\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*ptr) \{}
\CommentTok{// ptr will point to "Hi"}
    \NormalTok{puts(}\StringTok{"Hello World"}\NormalTok{);}
    \KeywordTok{return} \NormalTok{NULL;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{main() \{}
    \NormalTok{pthread_t id;}
    \NormalTok{pthread_create(&id, NULL, busy, }\StringTok{"Hi"}\NormalTok{);}
    \KeywordTok{while} \NormalTok{(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{) \{\} }\CommentTok{// Loop forever}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

If we want to wait for our thread to finish use \texttt{pthread\_join}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*result;}
\NormalTok{pthread_join(id, &result);}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the above example, \texttt{result} will be \texttt{null} because the
busy function returned \texttt{null}. We need to pass the address-of
result because \texttt{pthread\_join} will be writing into the contents
of our pointer.

\section{More pthread functions}\label{more-pthread-functions}

\subsection{How do I create a pthread?}\label{how-do-i-create-a-pthread}

See
\href{https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki/Pthreads,-Part-1:-Introduction}{Pthreads
Part 1} which introduces \texttt{pthread\_create} and
\texttt{pthread\_join}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{If I call \texttt{pthread\_create} twice,
how many stacks does my process
have?}{If I call pthread\_create twice, how many stacks does my process have?}}\label{if-i-call-pthreadux5fcreate-twice-how-many-stacks-does-my-process-have}

Your process will contain three stacks - one for each thread. The first
thread is created when the process starts, and you created two more.
Actually there can be more stacks than this, but let's ignore that
complication for now. The important idea is that each thread requires a
stack because the stack contains automatic variables and the old CPU PC
register, so that it can back to executing the calling function after
the function is finished.

\subsection{What is the difference between a full process and a
thread?}\label{what-is-the-difference-between-a-full-process-and-a-thread}

In addition, unlike processes, threads within the same process can share
the same global memory (data and heap segments).

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What does \texttt{pthread\_cancel}
do?}{What does pthread\_cancel do?}}\label{what-does-pthreadux5fcancel-do}

Stops a thread. Note the thread may not actually be stopped immediately.
For example it can be terminated when the thread makes an operating
system call (e.g. \texttt{write}).

In practice, \texttt{pthread\_cancel} is rarely used because it does not
give a thread an opportunity to clean up after itself (for example, it
may have opened some files). An alternative implementation is to use a
boolean (int) variable whose value is used to inform other threads that
they should finish and clean up.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What is the difference between \texttt{exit}
and
\texttt{pthread\_exit}?}{What is the difference between exit and pthread\_exit?}}\label{what-is-the-difference-between-exit-and-pthreadux5fexit}

\texttt{exit(42)} exits the entire process and sets the processes exit
value. This is equivalent to \texttt{return\ 42} in the main method. All
threads inside the process are stopped.

\texttt{pthread\_exit(void\ *)} only stops the calling thread i.e.~the
thread never returns after calling \texttt{pthread\_exit}. The pthread
library will automatically finish the process if there are no other
threads running. \texttt{pthread\_exit(...)} is equivalent to returning
from the thread's function; both finish the thread and also set the
return value (void *pointer) for the thread.

Calling \texttt{pthread\_exit} in the the \texttt{main} thread is a
common way for simple programs to ensure that all threads finish. For
example, in the following program, the \texttt{myfunc} threads will
probably not have time to get started.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{main() \{}
  \NormalTok{pthread_t tid1, tid2;}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid1, NULL, myfunc, }\StringTok{"Jabberwocky"}\NormalTok{);}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid2, NULL, myfunc, }\StringTok{"Vorpel"}\NormalTok{);}
  \NormalTok{exit(}\DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{); }\CommentTok{//or return 42;}

  \CommentTok{// No code is run after exit}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The next two programs will wait for the new threads to finish-

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{main() \{}
  \NormalTok{pthread_t tid1, tid2;}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid1, NULL, myfunc, }\StringTok{"Jabberwocky"}\NormalTok{);}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid2, NULL, myfunc, }\StringTok{"Vorpel"}\NormalTok{);}
  \NormalTok{pthread_exit(NULL); }

  \CommentTok{// No code is run after pthread_exit}
  \CommentTok{// However process will continue to exist until both threads have finished}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Alternatively, we join on each thread (i.e.~wait for it to finish)
before we return from main (or call exit).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{main() \{}
  \NormalTok{pthread_t tid1, tid2;}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid1, NULL, myfunc, }\StringTok{"Jabberwocky"}\NormalTok{);}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid2, NULL, myfunc, }\StringTok{"Vorpel"}\NormalTok{);}
  \CommentTok{// wait for both threads to finish :}
  \DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{* result;}
  \NormalTok{pthread_join(tid1, &result);}
  \NormalTok{pthread_join(tid2, &result); }
  \KeywordTok{return} \DecValTok{42}\NormalTok{;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Note the pthread\_exit version creates thread zombies, however this is
not a long-running processes, so we don't care. \#\# How can a thread be
terminated? * Returning from the thread function * Calling
\texttt{pthread\_exit} * Cancelling the thread with
\texttt{pthread\_cancel} * Terminating the process (e.g.~SIGTERM);
exit(); returning from \texttt{main}

\subsection{What is the purpose of
pthread\_join?}\label{what-is-the-purpose-of-pthreadux5fjoin}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Wait for a thread to finish
\item
  Clean up thread resources
\item
  Grabs the return value of the thread
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{What happens if you don't call
\texttt{pthread\_join}?}{What happens if you don't call pthread\_join?}}\label{what-happens-if-you-dont-call-pthreadux5fjoin}

Finished threads will continue to consume resources. Eventually, if
enough threads are created, \texttt{pthread\_create} will fail. In
practice, this is only an issue for long-running processes but is not an
issue for simple, short-lived processes as all thread resources are
automatically freed when the process exits.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Should I use \texttt{pthread\_exit} or
\texttt{pthread\_join}?}{Should I use pthread\_exit or pthread\_join?}}\label{should-i-use-pthreadux5fexit-or-pthreadux5fjoin}

Both \texttt{pthread\_exit} and \texttt{pthread\_join} will let the
other threads finish on their own (even if called in the main thread).
However, only \texttt{pthread\_join} will return to you when the
specified thread finishes. \texttt{pthread\_exit} does not wait and will
immediately end your thread and give you no chance to continue
executing.

\subsection{Can you pass pointers to stack variables from one thread to
another?}\label{can-you-pass-pointers-to-stack-variables-from-one-thread-to-another}

Yes. However you need to be very careful about the lifetime of stack
variables.

\begin{verbatim}
pthread_t start_threads() {
  int start = 42;
  pthread_t tid;
  pthread_create(&tid, 0, myfunc, &start); // ERROR!
  return tid;
}
\end{verbatim}

The above code is invalid because the function \texttt{start\_threads}
will likely return before \texttt{myfunc} even starts. The function
passes the address-of \texttt{start}, however by the time
\texttt{myfunc} is executes, \texttt{start} is no longer in scope and
its address will re-used for another variable.

The following code is valid because the lifetime of the stack variable
is longer than the background thread.

\begin{verbatim}
void start_threads() {
  int start = 42;
  void *result;
  pthread_t tid;
  pthread_create(&tid, 0, myfunc, &start); // OK - start will be valid!
  pthread_join(tid, &result);
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Intro to Race Conditions}\label{intro-to-race-conditions}

\subsection{How can I create ten threads with different starting
values.}\label{how-can-i-create-ten-threads-with-different-starting-values.}

The following code is supposed to start ten threads with values
0,1,2,3,\ldots{}9 However, when run prints out
\texttt{1\ 7\ 8\ 8\ 8\ 8\ 8\ 8\ 8\ 10}! Can you see why?

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{#include <pthread.h>}
\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{* myfunc(}\DataTypeTok{void}\NormalTok{* ptr) \{}
    \DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{i = *((}\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{*) ptr);}
    \NormalTok{printf(}\StringTok{"%d "}\NormalTok{, i);}
    \KeywordTok{return} \NormalTok{NULL;}
\NormalTok{\}}

\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{main() \{}
    \CommentTok{// Each thread gets a different value of i to process}
    \DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{i;}
    \NormalTok{pthread_t tid;}
    \KeywordTok{for}\NormalTok{(i =}\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i < }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{; i++) \{}
        \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid, NULL, myfunc, &i); }\CommentTok{// ERROR}
    \NormalTok{\}}
    \NormalTok{pthread_exit(NULL);}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The above code suffers from a \texttt{race\ condition} - the value of i
is changing. The new threads start later (in the example output the last
thread starts after the loop has finished).

To overcome this race-condition, we will give each thread a pointer to
it's own data area. For example, for each thread we may want to store
the id, a starting value and an output value:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{struct} \NormalTok{T \{}
  \NormalTok{pthread_t id;}
  \DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{start;}
  \DataTypeTok{char} \NormalTok{result[}\DecValTok{100}\NormalTok{];}
\NormalTok{\};}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

These can be stored in an array -

\begin{verbatim}
struct T *info = calloc(10 , sizeof(struct T)); // reserve enough bytes for ten T structures
\end{verbatim}

And each array element passed to each thread -

\begin{verbatim}
pthread_create(&info[i].id, NULL, func, &info[i]);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Why are some functions e.g. asctime,getenv, strtok, strerror
not
thread-safe?}\label{why-are-some-functions-e.g.-asctimegetenv-strtok-strerror-not-thread-safe}

To answer this, let's look at a simple function that is also not
`thread-safe'

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{char} \NormalTok{*to_message(}\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{num) \{}
    \DataTypeTok{char} \DataTypeTok{static} \NormalTok{result [}\DecValTok{256}\NormalTok{];}
    \KeywordTok{if} \NormalTok{(num < }\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{) sprintf(result, }\StringTok{"%d : blah blah"} \NormalTok{, num);}
    \KeywordTok{else} \NormalTok{strcpy(result, }\StringTok{"Unknown"}\NormalTok{);}
    \KeywordTok{return} \NormalTok{result;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

In the above code the result buffer is stored in global memory. This is
good - we wouldn't want to return a pointer to an invalid address on the
stack, but there's only one result buffer in the entire memory. If two
threads were to use it at the same time then one would corrupt the
other:

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}llll@{}}
\toprule
Time & Thread 1 & Thread 2 & Comments\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
1 & to\_m(5 ) &\tabularnewline
2 & & to\_m(99) & Now both threads will see ``Unknown'' stored in the
result buffer\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{What are condition variables, semaphores,
mutexes?}\label{what-are-condition-variables-semaphores-mutexes}

These are synchronization locks that are used to prevent race conditions
and ensure proper synchronization between threads running in the same
program. In addition, these locks are conceptually identical to the
primitives used inside the kernel.

\subsection{Are there any advantages of using threads over forking
processes?}\label{are-there-any-advantages-of-using-threads-over-forking-processes}

Yes! Sharing information between threads is easy because threads (of the
same process) live inside the same virtual memory space. Also, creating
a thread is significantly faster than creating(forking) a process.

\subsection{Are there any dis-advantages of using threads over forking
processes?}\label{are-there-any-dis-advantages-of-using-threads-over-forking-processes}

Yes! No- isolation! As threads live inside the same process, one thread
has access to the same virtual memory as the other threads. A single
thread can terminate the entire process (e.g.~by trying to read address
zero).

\subsection{Can you fork a process with multiple
threads?}\label{can-you-fork-a-process-with-multiple-threads}

Yes! However the child process only has a single thread (which is a
clone of the thread that called \texttt{fork}. We can see this as a
simple example, where the background threads never print out a second
message in the child process.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\OtherTok{#include <pthread.h>}
\OtherTok{#include <stdio.h>}
\OtherTok{#include <unistd.h>}

\DataTypeTok{static} \NormalTok{pid_t child = -}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{;}

\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*sleepnprint(}\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{*arg) \{}
  \NormalTok{printf(}\StringTok{"%d:%s starting up...}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{"}\NormalTok{, getpid(), (}\DataTypeTok{char} \NormalTok{*) arg);}

  \KeywordTok{while} \NormalTok{(child == -}\DecValTok{2}\NormalTok{) \{sleep(}\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{);\} }\CommentTok{/* Later we will use condition variables */}

  \NormalTok{printf(}\StringTok{"%d:%s finishing...}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{"}\NormalTok{,getpid(), (}\DataTypeTok{char}\NormalTok{*)arg);}

  \KeywordTok{return} \NormalTok{NULL;  }
\NormalTok{\}}
\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{main() \{}
  \NormalTok{pthread_t tid1, tid2;}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid1,NULL, sleepnprint, }\StringTok{"New Thread One"}\NormalTok{);}
  \NormalTok{pthread_create(&tid2,NULL, sleepnprint, }\StringTok{"New Thread Two"}\NormalTok{);}
  
  \NormalTok{child = fork();}
  \NormalTok{printf(}\StringTok{"%d:%s}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{"}\NormalTok{,getpid(), }\StringTok{"fork()ing complete"}\NormalTok{);}
  \NormalTok{sleep(}\DecValTok{3}\NormalTok{);}
    
  \NormalTok{printf(}\StringTok{"%d:%s}\CharTok{\textbackslash{}n}\StringTok{"}\NormalTok{,getpid(), }\StringTok{"Main thread finished"}\NormalTok{);}
  
  \NormalTok{pthread_exit(NULL);}
  \KeywordTok{return} \DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; }\CommentTok{/* Never executes */}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
8970:New Thread One starting up...
8970:fork()ing complete
8973:fork()ing complete
8970:New Thread Two starting up...
8970:New Thread Two finishing...
8970:New Thread One finishing...
8970:Main thread finished
8973:Main thread finished
\end{verbatim}

In practice, creating threads before forking can lead to unexpected
errors because (as demonstrated above) the other threads are immediately
terminated when forking. Another thread might have just lock a mutex
(e.g.~by calling malloc) and never unlock it again. Advanced users may
find \texttt{pthread\_atfork} useful however we suggest you usually try
to avoid creating threads before forking unless you fully understand the
limitations and difficulties of this approach.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Are there other reasons where \texttt{fork}
might be preferable to creating a
thread.}{Are there other reasons where fork might be preferable to creating a thread.}}\label{are-there-other-reasons-where-fork-might-be-preferable-to-creating-a-thread.}

Creating separate processes is useful * When more security is desired
(for example, Chrome browser uses different processes for different
tabs) * When running an existing and complete program then a new process
is required (e.g.~starting `gcc') * When you are running into
synchronization primitives and each process is operating on something in
the system

\section{Overview}\label{overview}

The next section deals with what happens when pthreads collide, but what
if we have each thread do something entirely different, no overlap?

We have found the maximum speedup parallel problems?

\subsection{Embarrassingly Parallel
Problems}\label{embarrassingly-parallel-problems}

The study of parallel algorithms has exploded over the past few years.
An embarrassingly parallel problem is any problem that needs little
effort to turn parallel. A lot of them have some synchronization
concepts with them but not always. You already know a parallelizable
algorithm, Merge Sort!

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\DataTypeTok{void} \NormalTok{merge_sort(}\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{*arr, size_t len)\{}
     \KeywordTok{if}\NormalTok{(len > }\DecValTok{1}\NormalTok{)\{}
     \CommentTok{//Mergesort the left half}
     \CommentTok{//Mergesort the right half}
     \CommentTok{//Merge the two halves}
     \NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

With your new understanding of threads, all you need to do is create a
thread for the left half, and one for the right half. Given that your
CPU has multiple real cores, you will see a speedup in accordance with
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law}{Amdahl's Law}. The
time complexity analysis gets interesting here as well. The parallel
algorithm runs in O(log\^{}3(n)) running time (because we fancy analysis
assuming that we have a lot of cores.

In practice though, we typically do two changes. One, once the array
gets small enough, we ditch the parallel mergesort algorithm and do a
quicksort or other algorithm that works fast on small arrays (something
something cache coherency). The other thing that we know is that CPUs
don't have infinite cores. To get around that, we typically keep a
worker pool.

\subsection{Worker Pool}\label{worker-pool}

We know that CPUs have a finite amount of cores. A lot of times we start
up a number of threads and give them tasks as they idle.

\subsection{Another problem, Parallel
Map}\label{another-problem-parallel-map}

Say we want to apply a function to an entire array, one element at a
time.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{*map(}\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{(*func)(}\DataTypeTok{int}\NormalTok{), }\DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{*arr, size_t len)\{}
    \DataTypeTok{int} \NormalTok{*ret = malloc(len*}\KeywordTok{sizeof}\NormalTok{(*arr));}
    \KeywordTok{for}\NormalTok{(size_t i = }\DecValTok{0}\NormalTok{; i < len; ++i) }
        \NormalTok{ret[i] = func(arr[i]);}
    \KeywordTok{return} \NormalTok{ret;}
\NormalTok{\}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Since none of the elements depend on any other element, how would you go
about parallelizing this? What do you think would be the best way to
split up the work between threads.

\subsection{Scheduling}\label{scheduling}

There are a few ways to split up the work. * static scheduling: break up
the problems into fixed size chunks (predetermined) and have each thread
work on each of the chunks. This works well when each of the subproblems
take roughly the same time because there is no additional overhead. All
you need to do is write a loop and give the map function to each
subarray. * dynamic scheduling: as a new problem becomes available have
a thread serve it. This is useful when you don't know how long the
scheduling will take * guided scheduling: This is a mix of the above
with a mix of the benefits and the tradeoffs. You start with a static
scheduling and move slowly to dynamic if needed * runtime scheduling:
You have absolutely no idea how long the problems are going to take.
Instead of deciding it yourself, let the program decide what to do!

\href{https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/openmp-loop-scheduling}{source},
but no need to memorize.

\subsection{Few Drawbacks}\label{few-drawbacks}

You won't see the speedup right away because of things like cache
coherency and scheduling extra threads.

\subsection{Other Problems}\label{other-problems}

\section{Questions}\label{questions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What happens when a pthread gets created? (you don't need to go into
  super specifics)
\item
  Where is each thread's stack?
\item
  How do you get a return value given a \texttt{pthread\_t}? What are
  the ways a thread can set that return value? What happens if you
  discard the return value?
\item
  Why is \texttt{pthread\_join} important (think stack space, registers,
  return values)?
\item
  What does \texttt{pthread\_exit} do under normal circumstances (ie you
  are not the last thread)? What other functions are called when you
  call pthread\_exit?
\item
  Give me three conditions under which a multithreaded process will
  exit. Can you think of any more?
\item
  What is an embarrassingly parallel problem?
\end{itemize}
