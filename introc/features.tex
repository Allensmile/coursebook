\section{Features}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Speed. There is very little separating you and the system.
	\item Simplicity.
    C and its standard library comprise a simple set of portable functions.
	\item Manual Memory Management.
    C gives you the ability you manage your memory.
    However, this can bite you if you have memory errors.
  \item Ubiquity.
    Through foreign function interfaces (FFI) and language bindings of various types, most other languages can call C functions, and vice versa.
    The standard library is also everywhere.
    C has stood the test of time as a popular language, and it doesn't look like it is going anywhere.
