# The Wikibook Project

The Wikibook Project is an aim to standardize and improve [the original wikibook](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki).

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Afraid of latex? Don't be!

If you want to contribute, all you need to do is
1. Fork
2. Make the changes by
    1. Going to the appropriate chapter
    2. Make changes either online or on the command line
    3. Make a PR
3. The PR will be cleared up and on build, a new version of the wikibook will be released and deployed!

### Contributing Guidlines

If you want to make a quick typo fix or a quick formatting fix, make the pull request and it should be resolved soon.

Otherwise, you should probably make an issue first to see what either the course staff or the professor has to say about it. Examples of something like this could be adding a new chapter, adding a substantial amount about some topic, adding more "fun examples", or changing the build system.

## Goals

* Improve the quality and rigour of the original wikibook
* Keep the openness aspect hand have this be a repository people can make pull requests into.
* Improve the factualness by including citations, footnotes, extended reading, and a glossary
* Have exports in the form of pdf and html
* The content of the wikibook should be in between the current wikibook and an exhaustive survey of linux programming
* Have ownership of the book in case it should go into syndication or something similar
* Have travis build so people don't need to install a bunch of pre-reqs to get started.

## What that means
* Not everything you find on here will be in the quiz
* This is class is meant to be pragmatic. Unless extremely relevent, you won't get asked to cite dates and facts.
