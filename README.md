Welcome to the systems programming coursebook!
This repository houses a high-quality, open-source introductory systems programming textbook used by the [CS 241 Systems Programming](http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu/) course at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/)
The book assumes that you have taken a programming language course and are familiar with assembly instructions.
All of the code and instruction will be in C, as it is the de-facto language of the Linux Kernel.

The Coursebook is an aim to standardize and build upon Angrave's [original wikibook experiment](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki).

The most recent version of the coursebook as a single pdf is here: [main.pdf](https://github.com/illinois-cs241/coursebook/blob/pdf_deploy/main.pdf).

## Overview

### Goals

* Improve the quality and rigour of the original wikibook while maintaining openness.
* Improve the factualness by including citations, footnotes, extended reading, and a glossary.
* Have exports in the form of pdf, markdown, and html.
* Automagically build so writers can focus on writing.

### Scripts

## Documentation, Structure

- All directories that don't start with `_` are a chapter in the coursebook
  a chapter is a tex file with bib files and optional images
- `github_redefinitions.tex` - Various redefinitions so that pandoc recognizes files
- `glossary.tex` - Various glossary files
- `latexmkrc` - Configuration file for latexmk. Currently, it only deals with glossary generation.
- `LICENSE.code` Licenses all the code in the book
- `main.tex` - The top level tex files that compiles all the other files
- `Makefile` Tried and true makefile for buildings. We don't need ya fancy build systems
- `order.tex` This file is autogenerated from the `order.yaml` file so that the actual ordering of the chapter stays in one place
- `order.yaml` This file controls the ordering of the chapter. Changing this and typing make will cause `order.tex` to be reformatted.
- `prelude.tex` contains all of the includes and definitions before the start of the document in main. This is a different file solely so that we can accurately convert each chapter with pandoc. More in the `_scripts/gen_wiki.py`
- `rebuilder.sh` Efficiently autobuilds the files for maximum productivity
- `requirements.txt` python requirements if you are building the `wiki` version of the coursebook
- `_scripts` This folder contains various scripts to do different things like generate the wiki, spellcheck etc.

# Versioning

To version the repo you should use <term><year>-num . The term-year combo are simple way of denoting that this is the version of the book for the current semester. `num` is simply an incrementer for bug fixes, or material that was already covered in lecture and just needs to be added to the book. No `num` release will introduce no material that was not introduced in lecture or is not extra.
