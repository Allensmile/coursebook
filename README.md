The Wikibook Project is an aim to standardize and improve [the original wikibook](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki).

## Goals

* Keep the openness aspect hand have this be a repository people can make pull requests into.
* Improve the factualness by including citations, footnotes, and extended reading
* Have exports in the form of pdf and html
* The content of the wikibook should be in between the current wikibook and an exhaustive survey of linux programming
* Have ownership of the book in case it should go into syndication or something similar
* Have travis build so people don't need to install a bunch of pre-reqs to get started.
